In these three screenshot :-

    <body> element contains the visible content of the HTML document, including headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, etc.

    The <table> element represents a table structure with borders and rules attributes. Here the "border" attribute specifies the width of the table borders.

    Inside the <table> tag there are some other tags which are used :
    <thead> - adds a separate header to the table
    <th> - used to add table headings (used to create heading like, CARS, WATCHES, SHOES, VISIT LINK, DESCRIPTION, IMAGES)
    <tbody> - shows the main body of the table
    <tr> - represents rows
    <td> - used to create data cells
    there are two more attributes used inside <td> tag, 
          Colspan: Specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
          Rowspan: Specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
          The <img> tag is also used to attach some images inside the table and width and height attributes are used to adjust the size of the image. There are two more attributes used inside the <img> tag, first is "src" which contains the path of the image or source and the another is alternative "alt" which contains the information which is displayed if the image doesn't work
          The <a> anchor tag is used to create a link inside one cell of the row and the hyperlink is redirected to the image connected in the same row of the table.

          These steps are repeated three time to created the rows for cars, watches and shoes. Different images are attached to the different rows and links.

    Then there are body closing tag and the html closing tag.
